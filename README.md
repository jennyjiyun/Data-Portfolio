1) Restaurant Simulation (Python): Using object-oriented programming (OOP), develop a system that keeps track of a restaurant's status for every certain time period. 
  - Once a diner comes in, the system welcomes the diner.
  - Once a diner is seataed, the system shows a diner four different categories of menu items. The diner can choose any menu item from each category (Drink, Appetizer, Entree, Dessert).
  - Once a diner finshes eating, the system automatically calculates the cost of the meal for each diner based on their order.  
  - Once a diner is ready to leave, the system shows a message thanking the diner.

2) Real Estate Project (R): Build forecasting models for each of 5 different scenarios to find the best model that predicts movements in the real estate market specifically New Private Housing Units authorized by Building Permits (1-unit structures in Florida).
  The following forecasting models are built:
  - Naive Model
  - Regression Models (also add higher order polynomial in several models to capture the cyclical pattern in residuals)
  - Smoothing Model
  - ARIMA Model
  - Neural Network 
  - Classical time series decomposition
  - Theta
  - Vector Autoregression model (VAR): include other data that might help predict building permits (i.e. include unemployment rate, total nonfarm payroll, interest rate, discount rate for US, and new privately owned housing units started)
