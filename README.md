  Real Estate Project: Build forecasting models for each of 5 different scenarios to find the best model that predicts movements in the real estate market specifically New Private Housing Units authorized by Building Permits (1-unit structures in Florida).
  The following forecasting models are built:
  - Naive Model
  - Regression Models (also add higher order polynomial in several models to capture the cyclical pattern in residuals)
  - Smoothing Model
  - ARIMA Model
  - Neural Network 
  - Classical time series decomposition
  - Theta
  - Vector Autoregression model (VAR): include other data that might help predict building permits (i.e. include unemployment rate, total nonfarm payroll, interest rate, discount rate for US, and New Privately Owned Housing Units Started
